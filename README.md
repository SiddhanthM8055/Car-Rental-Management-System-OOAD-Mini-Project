•	The Car Rental System is used to support renting of cars for certain duration of time ranging from few hours to few weeks. The system possesses several local branches, primarily located near busy city areas, allowing the user to return the vehicle to a different location.

•	Each vehicle is added with a unique barcode and details like parking stall number which helps in locating the vehicle.

•	The system keeps track of information regarding the vehicles rented out by a specific user. 

•	It also provides a functionality of collecting late-fee for those vehicles that are returned after the due date.

•	The users will be able to search the vehicle inventory and reserve any vehicle available.

•	The system should maintain a vehicle log to track all events related to the vehicles.

•	The system notifies the users whenever the reservation is approaching the pickup date and when the vehicle is not returned within the due date.
